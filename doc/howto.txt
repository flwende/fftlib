Building fftlib
===============

    Compile src/fftlib.cpp into fftlib.o via:

        CXX -[f,q]openmp -std=c++11 -I../include -I<path-to-[fftw/mkl]-library>/include -Dddd -c fftlib.cpp

    ddd can have the following values (you can combine any of these):
 
        FFTLIB_BYPASS        -> bypass fftlib's internal logic
        FFTLIB_USE_MKL       -> use symbols from MKL's fft library
        FFTLIB_THREADSAFE    -> use this when multiple threads access fftlib
        FFTLIB_OWN_LOCK      -> use fftlib's reader/writer lock
        FFTLIB_UNSAFE_OPT    -> activate unsafe optimizations in fftlib
        FFTLIB_DEBUG         -> print debug messages (infos and warnings)
        FFTLIB_WARNINGS_ONLY -> print warnings only
	FFTLIB_COMPOSED_FFT  -> split 3d FFT computation into 2d+1d FFT

    Tested with gcc-[4.9,5.3] and Intel Compiler 16.0.[1,2,3], and FFTW 3.3.4 and Intel MKL.

    Example:

       g++ -fopenmp -std=c++11 -I./include -I$FFTWROOT/include -DFFTLIB_THREADSAFE -c src/fftlib.cpp

       icpc -qopenmp -std=c++11 -I./include -I$MKLROOT/include/fftw -DFFTLIB_USE_MKL -DFFTLIB_THREADSAFE -c src/fftlib.cpp

Using fftlib
============

    The fftlib.o file needs to be added to the object file list of your project before dynamically linking against the actual fft library.
